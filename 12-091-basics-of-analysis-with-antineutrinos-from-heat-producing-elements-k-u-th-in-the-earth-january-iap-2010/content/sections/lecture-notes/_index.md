| 1 | Relevance to antineutrino analysis of global concentration determination of radiogenic heat producing elements (HPE) by terrestrial heat flow studies and Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) models, and unconventional models of the Earth's core. | ([PDF - 4.4MB]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/lecture-notes/mit12_091iap10_lec1)) |
| 2 | Basic radiation characteristics of heat producing elements (HPE): Alpha, beta, gamma, neutrino and antineutrino radiations, Basics of radiation detection concepts, Special focus: antineutrino radiation detection. | ([PDF - 4.5MB]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/lecture-notes/mit12_091iap10_lec2)) |
| 3 | Relevance of existing large antineutrino detectors for probing the HPE in Earth's deep interior: Characteristics, research and contributions of the two existing antineutrino detectors - Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO), Canada and Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND), Japan. | ([PDF - 1.8MB]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/lecture-notes/mit12_091iap10_lec3)) |
| 4 | Proposed antineutrino detectors for probing the HPE in Earth's deep interior with directional sensitivity. Tomography of the whole Earth for the localization of the HPE in the deep interior of the Earth. Need for mobile antineutrino detectors for tomography. | ([PDF - 1.7MB]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/lecture-notes/mit12_091iap10_lec4)) |
| 5 | Considerations for dedicated antineutrino detectors to probe the Earth's deep interior for the determination of concentrations of heat producing elements. | ([PDF - 1.7MB]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/lecture-notes/mit12_091iap10_lec5))
